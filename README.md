<h1 align="center">Kapow! Comic Collection</h1>

[View the live project here.](https://kapow-comics.herokuapp.com/)

Kapow Comic Collection is a hub where comic collectors can add the data of recent comics they have read or actually have in their possession such as rare types. Users will be able to sign up to their own profile page. Perhaps they wish to tag comics that they like or wish to add their own comics that they read in the collection. In addition to this Users will be able to edit or delete any of they added comics on the website.  As more users subscribe so the database will increase. Links will eventually be  added to eBay or a website where they can purchase the comics. 

As the base grows the site will extend to include some extra features such as: a blog, a fan page that extends to social network. A database of Superheroes will also be included.

        2. As a Returning Visitor, I want to find the best way to get in contact with the organisation with any questions I may have.
        3. As a Returning Visitor, I want to find community links.

    -   #### Frequent User Goals

        2. As a Frequent User, I want to check to see if there are any new blog posts.

-   ### Design
    -   #### Colour Scheme
        - I have opted for a comic theme of bright colors echoing the comics from yesteryear.
        - The use of black as the main color of the type is important - mimicing the type of those ink drawn comics.
        - #fffde7 yellow lighten-5 (from Materialize): This was used for the forms and echo the color of the pages comics and how old they become.
        - #00bcd4 cyan (from Materialize): This was used to represent superman's uniform. Maybe a bit of a cliche but something the User will immediatly identify with.
        - 

    -   #### Typography
        - In regards to the text, again I have tried to follow the traditional comic fonts where possible and where it does not intervene with the readibility.  
        - The main logo is set in "Permanent Marker" from google fonts. At first I used Bungee Shade but I felt tghis did not reflect totally the comic feel of old styled comics of yesteryear. I also used "Permanent Marker" for some of the main copy such as below the headlins on the comics page and Sign-in Sign-up ppages. However for the main copy of the synopsis of the "comic cards", i opeted for Roboto to me clearer.
        - In terms of the icons, I have gone with a mixture of Materialize and Font Awesome icons. 


    -   #### Imagery
        - As this project is about comics the typical imagery of comic art is important. The home page reflects this with an image of comics in the background.

### Testing User Stories from User Experience (UX) Section

-   #### First Time Visitor Goals

    1. As a First Time Visitor, I want to easily understand the main purpose of the site and learn more about the organisation.

        1. Upon entering the site, users are automatically greeted with a clean and easily readable navigation bar to go to the page of their choice. Underneath there is a Hero Image with Text and a "Learn More" Call to action button.
        2. The main points are made immediately with the hero image
        3. The user has two options, click the call to action buttons or scroll down, both of which will lead to the same place, to learn more about the organisation.

    2. As a First Time Visitor, I want to be able to easily be able to navigate throughout the site to find content.

        1. The site has been designed to be fluid and never to entrap the user. At the top of each page there is a clean navigation bar, each link describes what the page they will end up at clearly.
        2. At the bottom of the first 3 pages there is a redirection call to action to ensure the user always has somewhere to go and doesn't feel trapped as they get to the bottom of the page.
        3. On the Contact Us Page, after a form response is submitted, the page refreshes and the user is brought to the top of the page where the navigation bar is.

    3. As a First Time Visitor, I want to look for testimonials to understand what their users think of them and see if they are trusted. I also want to locate their social media links to see their following on social media to determine how trusted and known they are.
        1. Once the new visitor has read the About Us and What We Do text, they will notice the Why We are Loved So Much section.
        2. The user can also scroll to the bottom of any page on the site to locate social media links in the footer.
        3. At the bottom of the Contact Us page, the user is told underneath the form, that alternatively they can contact the organisation on social media which highlights the links to them.

-   #### Returning Visitor Goals

    1. As a Returning Visitor, I want to find the new programming challenges or hackathons.

        1. These are clearly shown in the banner message.
        2. They will be directed to a page with another hero image and call to action.

    2. As a Returning Visitor, I want to find the best way to get in contact with the organisation with any questions I may have.

        1. The navigation bar clearly highlights the "Contact Us" Page.
        2. Here they can fill out the form on the page or are told that alternatively they can message the organisation on social media.
        3. The footer contains links to the organisations Facebook, Twitter and Instagram page as well as the organization's email.
        4. Whichever link they click, it will be open up in a new tab to ensure the user can easily get back to the website.
        5. The email button is set up to automatically open up your email app and autofill there email address in the "To" section.

    3. As a Returning Visitor, I want to find the Facebook Group link so that I can join and interact with others in the community.
        1. The Facebook Page can be found at the footer of every page and will open a new tab for the user and more information can be found on the Facebook page.
        2. Alternatively, the user can scroll to the bottom of the Home page to find the Facebook Group redirect card and can easily join by clicking the "Join Now!" button which like any external link, will open in a new tab to ensure they can get back to the website easily.
        3. If the user is on the "Our Favourites" page they will also be greeted with a call to action button to invite the user to the Facebook group. The user is incentivized as they are told there is a weekly favourite product posted in the group.

-   #### Frequent User Goals

    1. As a Frequent User, I want to check to see if there are any newly added challenges or hackathons.

        1. The user would already be comfortable with the website layout and can easily click the banner message.

    2. As a Frequent User, I want to check to see if there are any new blog posts.

        1. The user would already be comfortable with the website layout and can easily click the blog link

### Further Testing

-   The Website was tested on Google Chrome, Internet Explorer, Microsoft Edge and Safari browsers.
-   The website was viewed on a variety of devices such as Desktop, Laptop, iPhone7, iPhone 8 & iPhoneX.
-   A large amount of testing was done to ensure that all pages were linking correctly.
-   Friends and family members were asked to review the site and documentation to point out any bugs and/or user experience issues.

### Known Bugs

-   On some mobile devices the Hero Image pushes the size of screen out more than any of the other content on the page.
    -   A white gap can be seen to the right of the footer and navigation bar as a result.
-   On Microsoft Edge and Internet Explorer Browsers, all links in Navbar are pushed upwards when hovering over them.

### Bug Fix

Backend
-   Was deploying on Heroku but showed an error pymongo Auth fail. I worked out that my MONGO_URI Connection was incorrect.
-   Tried to sign in as "admin" but was thrown an error "UnboundLocalError: local variable 'favorite' referenced before assignment". The reason for this was that the "favorite" value had been assigned to the  user but not to the admin

```
$ git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY
```

7. Press Enter. Your local clone will be created.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY
> Cloning into `CI-Clone`...
